# TallyGo-Android-Reference-App

This reference app is provided to demonstrate how to use the [TallyGo SDK](https://tallygo.com). The examples within correspond to the examples published on our [documentation site](https://tallygo.com/docs/android). Check it out for further explanation!

## Prerequisites

Some of the later examples work in conjunction with our [reference server](https://github.com/tallygo/TallyGo-Reference-Server). These ones are noted as such, so don't worry about setting this up unless you are interested in those specifically.

Building a working application requires an active TallyGo access token, you can get your own [here](https://tallygo.com/signup).
